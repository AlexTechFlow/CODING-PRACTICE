// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // fit scales to fit the browser window while keeping the aspect ratio
var width = 1024; // can go higher...
var height = 768;
var frame = new zim.Frame(scaling, width, height); // see docs for more options and info

	// We will make a zim.Emitter shoot a streamer
	// A particle is said to decay when it stops moving
	// A particle is said to fizz when the life time is up and it disappears
	// We will capture a decayed event to then set an explosion
	// The explosion is another zim.Emitter that we place at the streamer particle's position
	// We then clone these so that we can run two fireworks at the same time
	// Don't go crazy!  Watch out for performance...

	// make a zim.Emitter() to emit the streamer for the firework
	var shoot = new zim.Emitter({

		// Here we specify the object to emit (the Emitter clones the object)
		// We can pass in a single object or any ZIM VEE value from which each particle will be picked
		// ZIM VEE values are as follows:
		// 1. an Array of values to pick from - eg. ["red", "green", "blue"]
		// 2. a Function that returns a value - eg. function(){return Date.now();}
		// 3. a ZIM RAND object literal - eg. {min:10, max:20, integer:true, negative:true} max is required (not applicable for the obj parameter)
		// 4. any combination of the above - eg. ["red", function(){x>100?["green", "blue"]:"yellow"}] zik is recursive
		// 5. a single value such as a Number, String, zim.Rectangle(), etc. this just passes through unchanged (like we have here)
		// the emitter will use zik() to pick for each particle it emits
		obj:new zim.Circle(2,null,"black",1),

		// adjust properties randomly for each particle
		// the values for the properties can be any ZIM VEE value
		// can also use this to set a property of a cloned emitter - just put the value you want
		// for example: random:{x:300} would set the x of all the particles to 300
		// see also horizontal and vertical parameters for random positioning...
		random:{color:[frame.blue, frame.green, frame.pink, frame.yellow, frame.orange]},

		// trace will make the particle repeat itself as it travels
		// width and height are important as this specifies the cache dimension for tracing

		// we are passing in a RAND object which is recived by zik to randomly pick an interval
		// The zik options are as follows:
		// 1. an array of options
		// 2. an object with min, max, integer, negative values (like we use here)
		// 3. a function returning a value
		// 4. a combination of the above as zik is fully recursive
