// Exercises: simple loops


// EXERCISE: Multiplication Tables

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    var total = counter * 9;
    console.log(counter + " * 9 = " + total);
}

// EXERCISE: The even/odd reporter

// Write a "for" loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

for (var index = 0; index < 20; index++) {
    if (index % 2 === 0) }
    console.log(index + " is even");
    } else {
        console.log(index + )
    }
